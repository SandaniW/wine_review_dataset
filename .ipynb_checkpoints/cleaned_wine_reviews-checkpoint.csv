Great sauv Blanc. Rich and fruity. Plenty of thick citrus flavor. It's velvety and buttery texture pairs nice with the deep pear and melon notes that appear at the finish. Probably the best sauv Blanc I've had. The oak is there but not overly perceptible. I'm so impressed at the balance of this wine. It doesn't do anything funky and let's you settle into a great summer day afternoon drink.,great sauv blanc rich and fruity plenty of thick citrus flavor its velvety and buttery texture pairs nice with the deep pear and melon notes that appear at the finish probably the best sauv blanc ive had the oak is there but not overly perceptible im so impressed at the balance of this wine it doesnt do anything funky and lets you settle into a great summer day afternoon drink
"2017 Vintage 
Enjoyed August 2019. 
Needed very little time to open. Quite an enjoyable Sauv Blanc. My notes are similar to those of Rocky T. Smooth, creamy, wonderful hints of citrus, melon with the addition of pear and peach flavors. Nice oak notes. I can understand if this would be too sweet or fruity for some, but I find that to be valuable to this SB, memorable, wanting more. This will be a go to for me.

"Wow, this is a real treat, a beautifully balanced Cali sauvignon blanc. On the nose, there is a honeyed tropicality which partners with the usual grassy grapefruit. The palate unfolds as I taste more, with an ethereal body complementing the vibrant acidity. A finish for days. A truly lovely wine.

Although this is the last vintage where they sourced fruit from non estate vineyards. This gives much more fruit characteristics than the estate vineyards.

"THANK YOU BETH!!

This was such a generous gift Boy a wonderful person I met through Vivino. One of my fav grapes in a different Style. 

Shiny yellow with golden hues. This is a heavier Style than I am used to. Med+ body and 14% vol. 
Scents of lemon, pineapple and papaya. Really juicy mouthfeel with an exotic touch. Tangy acidity but at the same time nearly a creamy texture. Long limey and fresh finish with some herbal notes.

"Tied with Mark David's Transitus as the best sauv blancs I've had. They managed to take a varietal I generally regard as simple with limited variation that attempts to win the crowd with sweetness, and made it into a sleek, finessed version that tamed the fruit and made this a serious wine. Reminds me of the new serious white zin trend, I could get used to more sauv blancs being made like this.",tied with mark davids transitus as the best sauv blancs ive had they managed to take a varietal i generally regard as simple with limited variation that attempts to win the crowd with sweetness and made it into a sleek finessed version that tamed the fruit and made this a serious wine reminds me of the new serious white zin trend i could get used to more sauv blancs being made like this
"An extremely well composed white Californian wine. Nice fragrance of jasmine, and honeysuckle. The palate is dominated by citrus, stone fruits and minerality. An exceptional fresh and delicate wine. I was introduced to this wine at a Danish restaurant. It is impossible to get this brand in Norway and Sweden (State monopoly in both countries). If anybody knows where to get hold of this wine please let me know. This wine got 93 points by Wine Spectator.

Highly recommended

"The Merry Edwards booth was a highlight of the wine show. There were six Pinot Noirs, a Chardonnay, and this outstanding Sauvignon Blanc. The addition of 30% Sauvignon Musqu√© gave this wine a completely new dimension, with notes of honeysuckle, cantaloupe, ginger, and white peach.
